Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-4-6
---------------------------
Updated slick.load.min.js slide--current class to reflect the new grid option.
Added info to Slick Views about the difference between Module grid and the
  library grid. The module Grid feature has been around before the Slick library
  officiallly supported it at Slick 1.5.
Added options for builtin Grid system: rows and slidesPerRow.
Updated the verticalScrolling option to verticalSwiping. Be sure to re-save it
  to pick-up the newly renamed option.
Updated to Slick 1.5.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-3-31
----------------------------
\o/ at last .... happy for a great Alpha release ;)
Added various relevant useful info somewhere to clarify the intention.
Added relevant info on sanitization at slick.theme.inc which should be handled
  by implementors since most are renderable array.
Added sanitization on Slick Views slide captions.
Updated slick_devel_preprocess_slick() to drop data-slick test to reflect its
  removal at Slick 1.5, see:
  https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/issues/1058
Fixed wrong name slick_inline_css_output_info() to use the actual module name
  slick_fields_inline_css_output_info().
Added slick_inline_css_output_info_alter() to modify the inline CSS outputs.
Issue #2461693 by rfnbnkr: asNavFor stopped working with AJAX loaded slicks.
Moved sanitization for asnavfor_target to template_preprocess_slick().
Fixed trivial edge cases with extra white spaces for asnavfor targets.
Fixed line breaks after php tags.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-3-30
----------------------------
Fixed both phpcs and coder false positive with list() skipped value.
Fixed disappeared admin tooltip after AJAX which seemingly broke at some point.
Fixed phpcs complains with Closing parenthesis of array declaration.
Issue #2459669 by emcniece: Handle non-init'd jQuery Update module settings.
Issue #2459657 by emcniece: Add better error message for missing files /
  improper library install.
Updated SLICK_VERSION from 1.4 to 1.x to avoid chasing minor releases.
Changed slick_attach() to move slick_arrows() and slick_dots() invocation till
  requested.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-3-21
----------------------------
Fixed edge-case issues with deleted optionset while being used.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-3-14
----------------------------
Changed "data-thumb" to be always available not only for dots thumbnail hover,
  but also for custom advanced works with arrows containing thumbnails as long
  as "Thumbnail style" option is provided. It is up to you to build such complex
  arrows. See the current customPaging implementation on how to manipulate dots
  with lazy-loaded thumbnails which appears on hovering dots. The similar
  technique is also applied to build Photobox thumbnail navigation. If you
  don't make use thumbnails dots, nor arrows, nor Photobox thumbnails, simply
  leave the option empty.
Removed wasted slide--before and slide--after classes from
  Drupal.slick.setCurrent() since it is never implemented so far.
Fixed skin arrows and dots not being recognized by slick_navigations(), and
  dropped it in favor of slick_dots() and slick_arrows() instead.
Added slick_elements_info_alter(), slick_responsive_elements_info_alter(), and
  slick_options_info_alter() to allow modifying slick options and form elements
  by custom module after stable release without having to wait for the features
  to be added or another release. Or when a module wants to modify slick options
  internally such as when building a modular slick.
Fixed for duplicated/cloned thumbnails being displayed at Photobox.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-3-10
----------------------------
Added the bad boy verticalScrolling option to drag up and down the slide. Use
  slick_devel module to test it. "Ken tired of this":
  https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/issues/1001
  If you want your feature request fullfilled, make him tired ;)
Added info about the data-slick to be removed at Slick 1.5 to slick_devel.
  See https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/issues/1058
  The data-slick is never used by the module unless for development purposes.
Fixed autoplay for Photobox videos, and moved the Colorbox autoplay logic from
  JS to PHP to share between lightboxes.
Removed thumbnail_hover DOM markups -- thumbnails which appear on hovering dots,
  and used data-thumb attributes managed by JS option customPaging instead.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-3-9
---------------------------
Updated slick_example asNavFor to not use field template for the main display.
Removed extra ISSET checks by proper definitions in
  slick_get_element_default_settings().
Removed wasted "slick--progressive" class, and only provided "slick--ondemand"
  class only if the lazyLoad is ondemand to keep the current fix with excessive
  height of dummy image.
Removed wasted "slick--display--main" class, and only provide one if it has
  thumbnail navigation in companion with "slick--display--thumbnail".
Split "media-icon--lightbox" rules from "slick.colorbox.css" into
  "slick.lightbox.css" to share icon stylings between Colorbox and Photobox.
Deprecated "media-icon--colorbox" for the more generic "media-icon--lightbox".
Updated slick-media.tpl.php to reflect the support for Photobox, adding
  variable $is_lightbox to check for either Colorbox or Photobox.
Added Photobox integration.
Removed Drupal.slick.thumbnail(), and moved the relevant "slick-dots--thumbnail"
  class to dotsClass option instead.
Deprecated "slick__thumbnail" class in favor of "slick-dots--thumbnail".
  If you customized it, be sure to update to "slick-dots--thumbnail", as it will
  be removed at proper release. It is a problematic class, since dotsClass is
  actually alterable child element. However default "slick-dots" is the only
  class to rely on now as a child block level element. If you change the
  options, assumed you know how to handle them consistently anyway.
Added skin description and breakpoints to the slick collection page at:
  admin/config/media/slick
Added slick_navigations(), hook_slick_dots_info() and hook_slick_arrows_info()
  to add custom dots and arrows CSS programatically, similar to existing
  hook_slick_skins_info(), only without defaults and cares for CSS. It reduces
  repetitive tasks with different sets of re-usable arrows and dots skin assets.
Added an alterable slick_fields_get_default_settings() to avoid database lookup
  just to check if a setting is already set, or not, reducing a few extra ISSET
  checks at frontend.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-3-5
---------------------------
Fixed off-screen/ hidden dots with Fullscreen due to core negative margin -45px.
Fixed Views admin preview with full screen skin by adding a min-height 320px.
Fixed various pareview.sh complains, and a few resolvable false positives.
Fixed CRUD typecasting with slick_optionset_save().
Fixed various tests failures locally sans codespell.
Added tests for simpletest based on flexslider.test, and corrected its failures.
  Due credit to Flexslider.
Added hook_help().

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-3-2
---------------------------
Fixed arrows not being recognized for the nested slicks.
Fixed JS settings typecast for slick_example_slick_default_presets().
Fixed Undefined index: rtl in template_preprocess_slick().
Fixed typecast values before storing. It doesn't affect slick, just cleanup.
Removed mousewheel data when disabled. It doesn't affect slick, just cleanup.
Removed useless options at slick_fields.module display Formatter form: optionset
  and optionset thumbnail labels.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-3-1
---------------------------
Fixed left-over overridable options for Field collection.
Fixed PHPCS complains with CSS multiline selectors leaving ignorable lowerCamel.
Fixed edge case asNavFor selectors -- non-empty, but not-used, asNavFor from
  breaking the slide. When it has value, but not actually used, or forgot to
  have the thumbnails. Otherwise breaking the slide.
Fixed arrows not being updated with different visibility and responsive options,
  as this is said left to implementor/module when arrows are customized.
  With the fix, arrows are enforced, but updated accordingly based on option.
Changed module_load_include() to form_load_include() or ctools_load_include() in
  the form context.
Added options to override optionset to re-use one optionset for a few different
  common displays with/without: Arrows, Autoplay, Dots and Draggable.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-27
----------------------------
Fixed un-styled checkbox for grouping at Views UI.
Added relevant cursor to slick.theme.css for draggable slick: grab and grabbing.
Changed dependencies on slick_example to make use of sub-modules instead.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-26
----------------------------
Fixed missing dependency on Views for Slick example module.
Fixed slick_example views with skin Rounded not being rounded due to option
  "Use field template" under "Style settings" was checked.
Fixed cssEaseBezier value not being mapped from cssEaseOverride at Optionset UI
  as part of optimization to move some logic to backend.
Issue #2438041 by RAFA3L: Fixed broken Views style plugin due to removal of
  files array from slick_views.info:
  files[] = slick_views_plugin_style_slick.inc
  Be sure to clear cache to bring it back. The mistake was after PHPCS fixes.
Fixed edge cases for slide--current class by requesting anon parent selector
  with/without theme_slick_wrapper(), and with/without asnavFor.
Optimized slick.elements.inc, and moved slick form elements from
  slick_get_options() to the plugin page - SlickOptionsetUi.class.php.
  The following functions are moved to slick.admin.inc:
  - _slick_easing_options()
  - _slick_css_easing_options()
  - _slick_css_easing_mapping()
Fixed undefined $overlay_style notice with Field collection nested slicks.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-25
----------------------------
Fixed various PHPCS complains, except the helpless CTools lowerCamel formats and
  CSS multiline selectors due to Sass bug :unix_newlines never applied, nor
  proper line break after decendant selectors.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-24
----------------------------
Simplified slick.tpl.php markups for when only 1 item is available.
Fixed slick.theme.css and slick.load.min.js to support nested slicks. Be sure
  to re-check your CSS with the new specifity introduced by nested slicks.
  Mostly related to .slide__caption and .slide__media classes e.g.:
  Before:
  .slide--caption--below .slide__caption {}
  After:
  .slide--caption--below > .slide__content > .slide__caption {}

  This allows child slicks within a slick to have proper skins, rather than
  being overridden by the parent slick.

Fixed for nested slicks, slicks within a slick for Field collection and Views.
Fixed RTL attributes from the .slick to .slick-slider to reflect Slick 1.4.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-20
----------------------------
Changed admin assests to use slick.admin library. Clear cache if trouble to see
  the admin styling.
Added slick.admin library.
Changed slick.load.js, slick.media.js and slick.colorbox.js with their
  minified versions, slick.load.min.js, slick.media.min.js and
  slick.colorbox.min.js, respectively to save some bytes.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-17
----------------------------
Updated to media_soundcloud 7.x-2.1 which removed ::getOEmbed method.
Fixed module slick.theme.css being overriden by library slick-theme.css.
Fixed media video/audio autoplay not being triggered when button play clicked.
Fixed media video carousel being sluggish due to the browser always request
  iframe SRC even when empty (about:blank). The iframe is now removed and stored
  in memory instead, and only made available when a play button clicked.

Updated slick.media.js to reflect the latest fix with afterChange.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-15
----------------------------
Fixed slide--current class not being applied when total <= slidesToShow, that is
  when slick-center class is not really centered, and when asNavFor applies, and
  when afterChange always fails.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-14
----------------------------
Added hook_slick_attach_info_alter() to alter slick_attach() before output.
Updated slick.api.php for the new skin CSS and JS array.
Fixed skin CSS overrides not being applied for multiple slick instances on the
  same page, by changing the array of skin CSS and JS to be keyed by file names
  rather than indeces. Relevant to Drupal 8 dynamic assets.
  If you don't override the skin CSS, the change is ignorable.
  Single instance or multiple without overriding skins are not effected.
  Unless you have multiple slick instances on the same page, previous overrides
  with indeces will still work though.
  The change now allows proper overrides and respect the orders accordingly, see
  hook_slick_skins_info_alter().
  If you have overridden the skin CSS, be sure to update it accordingly, see
  slick.api.php for the updated information.

Fixed skin Fullscreen inline CSS for slick_fields.module for Media and FC.

Fixed .slick__arrow parent selector relevant for Slick 1.4, see
  Drupal.slick.arrows().
  This core bug happens when total <= slidesTosShow and should be fixed by the
  implementor/module as the author suggested.
Fixed for skin 3d back relevant to the latest fix with afterChange and proper
  data-slick-index.
Updated slick.load.js to reflect the 1.4.1 fixes.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-3
---------------------------
Added more info related to ROADMAP and current delvelopment status at README.
Issue #2418149 by nrutkowski: Fixed for Slick 1.4 breaking changes.
Updated to Slick 1.4 with more tests and cleanups.
Fixed nullified edgeFriction due to typecast integer to float.
Updated the rest of year CHANGELOG from 2014 to 2015.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-2-1
---------------------------
Updated slick example to avoid Unslick and too large centerPadding which screws
  up slidesToShow at small breakpoints.
Updated year CHANGELOG from 2014 to 2015.
Removed useless merged.prevArrow + merged.nextArrow from slick.load.js since
  arrows already added by HTML whenever required.
Added hook_requirements() to slick.install.
Added thumbnail caption to slick_fields and slick_views like yahoo/youtube
  thumbnail captioning.


Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-1-30
----------------------------
Please read below before upgrading to Slick 1.4:
Breaking changes: https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/releases/tag/1.4.0
  - slide - The default value of the slide option has been changed to blank.
    This means that slick will use any direct children as slides, without having
    to specify which tag or selector to target.
    Consequencies:
    * Added direct child container within .slick to hold the slides, i.e.:
      .slick__slider. Previously slides are direct children of .slick container.
    * Slick consequently must be initilialized at .slick__slider, otherwise we
      always have one slide.
    * "slick__arrow" can not be placed within .slick container directly even
      with the previous workaround by adding a specific class, and different
      selector. To overcome this, added additional container .slick__slider
      within .slick, so that .slick__arrow is not fetched as part of slides.
    * focusOnSelect , e.g. with thumbnail navigation, will not work anymore, so
      .slick__slide class added automatically only when needed now.
    * All in all, this is mostly breaking asNavFor, so be sure to update the
      asNavFor selectors accordingly at Field formatter and Views pages, e.g.:
      Before: #slick-nodes targetting .slick container.
      After: #slick-nodes-slider (note "-slider") targetting .slick__slider.

      Or adding " .slick__slider" to your current selector should resolve, e.g.:
      Before: #slick-nodes
      After: #slick-nodes .slick__slider
      Apply it to both asNavFor Main and asNavFor Thumbnail.

      Or if you are using sub-modules, and unsure, simply check the new option:
      "asNavFor auto selector" at:
      - admin/structure/types/manage/CONTENT_TYPE/display
      - admin/structure/views/view/VIEW
      This will auto generate the proper asNavFor selectors accordingly instead.
      See README.txt for the new HTML structure

   - Methods replaced by events
     Consequencies:
     * Drupal.slick.callbacks dropped, encouraged to use events now, see
     slick.media.js.
     We can bring this callback back if any good reason other than placing
     it somewhere in the slick.load.js, only then it is not specific to library.

   - slick.css has been forked into two different files. slick.css is now the
     core functional slick css file, while slick-theme.css are the default
     styling.
     Consequencies:
     * slick-theme.css is optional, and only added if you have chosen a Skin.
     This is a great plus for advanced work, e.g.: use own arrow icons.

Added "Unslick" option to disable Slick at a given breakpoint. Note, you can't
  window shrink this, once you unslick, you are unslicked.
Added "asNavFor auto selectors" option to determine asNavFor selectors by the
  current field/view ID selectors automatically as opposed to manual selectors.
Updated slick.load.js, slick.media.js to use events, not callback anymore.
Updated slick.tpl.php, SlickOptionsetUi, etc. to deal with the breaking changes
  introduced at Slick 1.4.
  Be sure to update slick.tpl.php, etc., if already customized.
Updated to Slick 1.4.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-1-29
----------------------------
Added unslick option for Slick 1.4 to disable Slick at breakpoint.
Added mobileFirst option for Slick 1.4.

Added Slick example sub-module, be sure to have field_image and field_images as
  no fields installed by default, see admin/reports/fields.
Fixed for slick_devel_preprocess_slick() applied globally.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-1-26
----------------------------
Updated workarounds to become permanent, since core library leaves them to the
  implementors for various reasons, such as: mousewheel, arrows issues, etc.
Added slick_devel.module to ease developing the latest features of the library.
Updated data-slick-index reference to use static class with slide--N classes
  instead to make it compatible with slick 1.4 and below.
Added edgeFriction option as Swipetoslide fix, requires slick 1.4.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-1-25
----------------------------
Updated invalid index attribute to data-slick-index as per
  https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/issues/825, requires slick 1.4.

  See http://goo.gl/TJenKX
Added link field as option for slide title for both file and field collection.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-1-24
----------------------------
Added random option to randomize slide orders, useful to manipulate cached
  blocks such ads rotation, or random products.
  See https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/issues/359
  See http://reddit.com/r/slickcarousel/comments/2kyu51/random_slide_order

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2015-1-2
---------------------------
Dropped too general .slick__caption absolute positioning if no layout defined at
  slick.theme.css, to allow pure text slideshow such as testimonial, or quotes
  without extra overrides.

Added Translate link to file entity if translatable, basically to trigger/ bring
  to translation tab as defined at:
  admin/config/regional/entity_translation/translatable/FIELD_NAME
Added slide_classes to file entity and FC fields.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-12-27
-----------------------------
Fixed for Fatal error: Cannot access empty property in field.attach.inc on line
  324, if Media view_mode is not enabled.

Fixed slide_layout for Slick Views not being recognized if using List (text).
Fixed caption right placement being overriden by caption left.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-12-24
-----------------------------
Fixed coder review complain with missing asterix on the block comment.
Fixed Shiny admin theme issue clearing every form-item which should be displayed
  inline.

Dropped workaround for "on demand" lazyLoad. The issue is no longer valid.
However if the issue persists at your end, please try two possible fixes below.
Related old info:
Default lazyLoad "on demand" may have issue to generate newly created images,
causing 403.
Maybe related to itok: https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.20-release-notes
Possible fixes without compromising security:
- https://www.drupal.org/project/imageinfo_cache, to have derivatives in place.
- Use lazyLoad "progressive" instead.

lazyLoad ondemand also has issue with dummy image excessive height, so use it
with care. Dummy image is for valid HTML5.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-12-18
-----------------------------
Fixed wrong grid values for small devices.
Added more visible slides from 10 to 32.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-12-17
-----------------------------

Fixed the list negative margin used at Foundation grid.
Added notice to README about the Grid skin.

Added skin Grid to quickly build Slick grid carousel, slick.theme--grid.css
  as a starter. Use your own grid system, and overrides the classes as needed.
Added new options to Slick Views related to the Grid, Views only by now.

----------------------------
Added fixes for asNavFor to Media and Field Collection.
Added skin asNavFor.
Updated slick.load.js to have proper .slide--current classes for the thumbnail
  navigation since core don't provide one. With no centerMode .slick-active can
  be as many as visible slides, and the current slide has no special class.
Temp tips till core fix: Avoid centerMode for the thumbnails slideToShow > 3.

Updated slick-media.tpl and slick-item.tpl to have no markups for thumbnails.

----------------------------
issue #2309681 by immoreel: Added support for Omega 3 expecting classes_array.
Do not output slide__media wrapper if no main image and caption available. The
  case, e.g., main image left empty, and overlay image/media populated.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-07-25
-----------------------------
Added empty_option to Lazyload to allow sharing to Pinterest for small slides,
  since current Lazyload is a must, and img SRC attributes is always empty.

-----------------------------
Issue #2308591 by jmuzz:
- Fixed for specificity of breakpoints states.

Dropped slick-carousel.tpl.php, template_preprocess_slick_carousel() from
  slick.theme.inc
Dropped deprecated theme_slick_carousel() in favor of the unified theme_slick()
  for custom coded, Field formatter and Views for easy maintenance.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-07-13
-----------------------------
Added color_field support to Field Collection to colorize the slide text.
Fixed for Strict warning: Declaration of SlickViewsPluginStyleSlick::render()
  should be compatible with views_plugin_style::render() in
  _registry_check_code() (line 3139 ..., neglecting coder sniffs: "No scope
  modifier specified for function "render"
  [sniffer_squiz_scope_methodscope_missing]"
Added settings variables to template_preprocess_slick_item
Limit colorbox resize to non-images at slick.colorbox.js under onComplete.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-07-05
-----------------------------
Separated rules for slick.colorbox.css from slick.media.css
Started integration with Scald module as a separate project Scald Slick module.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-06-26
-----------------------------
Marked this feature complete for 1.3.6.
Added new options for future 1.3.7:
  - prevArrow
  - nextArrow
  - pauseOnDotsHover
   Latest Slick 1.3.6 is currently still buggy with responsive options not being
   read.

Added compatibility with Omega 4 which declares attributes_array already.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-06-24
-----------------------------
Added JS callbacks, see slick.api.js. Modules and themes may implement any of
  the Slick methods to interact with the Slick using Drupal.slick.callbacks
  namespace. JS Gurus, improvements are very much welcome.
Fixed inheritance issue with custom responsive options, including arrows wrapper
  and thumbnails.
Removed the thumbnail markups from slick.tpl.php, and its related leftover
  elsewhere.
Moved thumbnails inside slides, rather than separate list.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-06-23
-----------------------------
Removed two dup and useless problematic options from responsive options: slide
  and lazyLoad, since both _must inherit from the main settings.
Fixed scrolling behavior on colorbox closing, Drupal.slickColorbox.jumpScroll.
Changed skin Classic to reveal captions on active-slide rather than hover. To
  reveal it on hover, override and edit slick.theme--classic.css and replace
  .slick-active starting from line #96, and use pseudo :hover instead.
Added mousewheel option to slick_fields.module.
Fixed undefined index media_switch at slick_fields form.
Changed <div class="slick__arrow"> to <nav class="slick__arrow"> at slick.tpl
  as the last fail safe against the problematic anonymous DIV slide option. It
  is not an issue if data is passed into theme_slick() already. However copying
  the template and creating a custom theme without being aware of the issue will
  break the slide.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-06-16
-----------------------------
Fixed broken arrows due to problematic default anonymous DIV by forcing specific
  class .slick__slide to slide option.
Renamed and reorganized all CSS files to match Drupal 8 file organization, see
  https://drupal.org/node/1887922

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-06-13
-----------------------------
Added slick-views.tpl.php to satisfy Views UI template discovery.

Changed _slick_fields_get_media_thumbnail() to be reusable for thumbnail pagers.

Fixed checkboxes states with checked attributes at admin pages.
Added autoplay to Colorbox audio/video.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-06-09
-----------------------------
Added API file containing skin information.
Added more Views options to have consistent markups with the Field version.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-06-08
-----------------------------
Added optional Colorbox intergration to display image or video inside Colorbox,
  or as an image to iframe switcher.

Slick 7.x-2.0-dev, 2014-06-07
-----------------------------

Added Sass versions for slick.skin.css and slick.media.css.
Added basic skins to support various slide layouts.
Added direct layout options for core Image field. Media and Field collection
  should use a separate field instead with some pre-defined options.
Added slick.make file to download relevant libraries. We don't name it.example
  to allow simplytest.me download the library.
Added title, captions and overlay fields for Field Collection and Media
Added options to break down Media and Field collection fields to support custom
  displays for slide title, description, overlay audio/video/image, link, and
  layout fields.
Added supports for Field collection at slick_fields.module.
Added Picture module integration.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-05-25
-----------------------------
Added admin CSS and JS to make nice CTools UI.
Added responsive display options, and additional custom options.
Added slick.media.js to allow image to iframe switcher.
Reworked JS settings in the head to only output base defaults alone, with no
  extra items. Individual JS settings are stored as data attributes, only single
  one now.
Reworked the theme functions to merge HTML5 data attributes to store JS settings
  as a single JSON object within the Slick container rather than regular JS
  settings in the <head>.
Simplified logic at module slick.js. JS should not do hard work with typecast
  or parse separate multiple data attributes, PHP does. JS is now ready to
  consume valid JSON object, or nothing. This is relevant where bunch of JS
  settings with responsive displays get in.
Renamed module slick.js into slick.load.js, to avoid conflict with the library
  for debug purposes.
Renamed slick.css into slick.skin.css, otherwise Drupal overrides the library.
Renamed "theme" directory into "templates" for Drupal 8 auto discovery goodness.
Deprecating theme_carousel in favor of theme_slick. Will deprecate it, not yet.
Deleted slick.views.inc and slick_plugin_style_slick.inc files, and use a
  separate slick_views.module instead.

Added CTools plugin for exportable configuration via optionsets.
Added dependencies on CTools, and libraries modules at slick.info file.
Added supports for Image, and Media at slick_fields.module.
Added 2 sub-modules: slick_views and slick_fields.
Added slick.install to install database table for optionsets.
Added the file CHANGELOG.txt.
by gausarts: Reworked some architecture.
